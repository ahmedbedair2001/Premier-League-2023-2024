<h1>🚨⚽ The Premier League is Back! ⚽🚨</h1>
With the return of the Premier League 2023/2024, I decided to dive into the numbers and prepare a full report analyzing:
📊 Match schedules
👥 Attendance trends
🏆 Top 6 teams vs. other clubs
<Li>🔎 Key Insights from the analysis:</li> 
<ul>Attendance peaks in January, dips in November & March.</ul>
Morning games attract the largest crowds, but teams often struggle with win rates.  Evening & Regular games deliver stronger performance, though with smaller attendance.  Top 6 teams consistently enjoy higher attendance and stronger results in Regular & Evening matches.  Late & Occasional matches are the most volatile, causing fluctuations in fan turnout.  💡 Why this matters: Understanding fan behavior and performance patterns helps clubs, sponsors, and event organizers optimize scheduling, improve match-day experiences, and boost revenues.
